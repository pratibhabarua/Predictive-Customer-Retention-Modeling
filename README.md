# Predictive Customer Retention Modeling

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of predictive models to forecast customer churn and enhance retention strategies. The project leverages data analytics to gather insights from customer demographics, behavior, transactions, and interactions.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather data on customer demographics, behavior, transactions, and interactions.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and normalize data formats.
   - Standardize or normalize numerical features.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Create and aggregate features.

3. **Feature Selection**
   - Identify significant features using statistical tests and feature importance techniques.

4. **Data Resampling**
   - Use resampling techniques like SMOTEENN to handle imbalanced datasets.

5. **Model Selection**
   - Choose suitable algorithms and ensemble methods.
   - Algorithms include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning.

6. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
   - Train models and evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy and ROC-AUC.
   - Perform cross-validation to ensure model robustness.

## Summary

The predictive customer retention modeling project aims to develop effective strategies to forecast customer churn and improve retention rates. By following the outlined steps, this project ensures a comprehensive approach to data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
